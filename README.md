# Deep_Learning_Image_clasification

Project Overview
This project was developed during the summer of 2024, in collaboration with a professor, and focuses on classifying images into seven distinct categories. Each class contains 80 images, making up the dataset used for training and validation.

The goal was to build and evaluate a deep learning model using different transfer learning techniques like VGG16, DenseNet201, and Xception to determine the best-performing architecture for classifying the images.
